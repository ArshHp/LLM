            "Okay, I need to create a Fibonacci series using Python. Hmm, I remember the Fibonacci sequence is where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. So it starts with 0 and 1, right? Then each next number is 0+1=1, then 1+1=2, then 1+2=3, and so on.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wait, sometimes I've seen it start with 1 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. I should clarify that. Oh well, maybe the example can start with 0 and 1 for simplicity.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, how do I generate this in Python? I think I can use a loop. Let me think about the steps. First, I'll need to initialize the first two numbers, a and b, as 0 and 1. Then, for each iteration, I'll add them to get the next number.\n",
            "\n",
            "I should also ask the user how many terms they want in the series. That way, the program is flexible. So I'll start by getting an input from the user, maybe using input(), and convert it to an integer.\n",

            "Once I have the number of terms, I can start generating the series. I'll create a list to store the Fibonacci numbers. The first two terms are 0 and 1, so if the user asks for 1 term, it's just [0], for 2 terms, [0, 1], and so on.\n",
            "\n",
