              "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
              "AI refers to the broader field of research and development aimed at creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:\n",
              "Reasoning and problem-solving\n",
              "Learning from experience\n",
              "Understanding natural language\n",
              "Recognizing patterns and images\n",
              "AI encompasses a wide range of techniques, including machine learning, rule-based systems, and expert systems. The goal of AI is to create machines that can think and act like humans, making decisions and taking actions based on complex data and situations.\n",
              "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
              "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to learn from data, without being explicitly programmed. ML involves training machines on large datasets, so they can make predictions, classify objects, or make decisions based on patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
              "In other words, Machine Learning is a way to achieve AI by training machines to learn from data, rather than relying on pre-programmed rules or expert systems. ML is a key enabler of AI, as it allows machines to improve their performance over time, adapt to new situations, and make decisions based on complex data.\n",
              "Key differences between AI and ML:\n",
              "1. Scope: AI is a broader field that encompasses various techniques, including ML, while ML is a specific subset of AI that focuses on learning from data.\n",
              "2. Approach: AI often relies on pre-programmed rules or expert systems, whereas ML uses algorithms and statistical models to learn from data.\n",
              "3. Goal: AI aims to create machines that can think and act like humans, while ML focuses on developing machines that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.\n",

While AI aims to create machines that can think and act like humans, ML is a key enabler of AI, allowing machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
